<p><i>Is climate change real?</i><br/>
There is no room for debate on this anymore. <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/">It is.</a></p>

<p><i>Isn't this a futile symbolic gesture?</i><br/>
Symbolic gestures have been a part of politics since&hellip; forever. This isn't merely symbolic. If we want to change business, we must signal our readiness to be part of the mobilization necessary to achieve the transformation of our economy.</p>

<p><i>Is this a leftist anti-business initiative?</i><br/>
No, we love business and capitalism and believe that transforming the economy to address climate change is better for the economy, locally and worldwide.</p>

<p><i>I work on a project that accelerates climate change.</i><br/>
Many do. Now is the time to change that.</p>

<p><i>Should I leave my job?</i><br/>
Unless you are in a position to change the trajectory of your company or your industry, probably yes.</p>

<p><i>But I love my job / but I need the money.</i><br/>
If you found a way to justify the damaging results of your work to yourself, you probably aren't reading this. If you read this, rest assured that the economy most likely has enough alternative jobs in less problematic industries for a professional like you.</p>
