<p>The <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/">situation is dire</a>. You can be a part of the problem. Or be a part of the solution.</p>

<p>We have only a <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/session48/pr_181008_P48_spm_en.pdf">few years left to transform our industries</a>. Business as usual is not an option anymore. Business must change. We must change business.</p>

<p>Only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change">100 companies</a> are responsible for more than 70% of global emissions. Industries can change, if they want to.</p>

<p>Customers can boycott. Investors can divest. Governments can regulate.</p>

<p>We are the workforce, the freelancers, the contractors. We have responsibility. We can refuse to work for those who refuse to change.</p>
