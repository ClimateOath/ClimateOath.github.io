<p>I will refuse to work for companies or projects that accelerate the effects of climate change.</p>

<p>I will refuse to work to extract, refine, distribute, or consume more fossil fuels.</p>

<p>I will refuse to work to produce, design, or sell products based on internal combustion engines that consume fossil fuels.</p>

<p>I will refuse to work to manufacture products that raise the output of greenhouse gases or climate-damaging waste into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>I will refuse to work to lobby, advertise or greenwash for companies that engage in denying the urgency of climate change or that engage in blocking climate-related regulation of their industries.</p>

<p>I will refuse to train, educate or consult employees and contractors of such companies or projects.</p>

<p>I will prioritize work for companies or projects that combat climate change over business decisions that do not - even if it is less lucrative.</p>
